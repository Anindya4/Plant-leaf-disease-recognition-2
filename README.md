# **Plant leaf disease recognition (using Grapevine dataset)**
This project demonstrates the use of a deep learning model to classify plant leaf diseases using Grapvine dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset contains 4 classes in which 3 are diseased class one is healthy. The model leverages a pre-trained EfficientNet-B4 architecture, customized with additional layers, and is built using PyTorch.
